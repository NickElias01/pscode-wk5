// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

start

%Gather user input values
print "Please enter a value for x"
x = UserInput

print "Please enter a value for y"
y = UserInput

%Calculate sum 
sum = x + y
print(sum)

end



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

start

%Gather user input values
print "Please enter a value"
x = user input

%Check if remainder is 0 using modulo (%)
if x % 2 == 0
print "The number is even"

else
print "The number is odd"

end



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


start

%Ask user to input 5 values
	Print "Please input 5 values separated by commas"
	UserInput = {n1,n2,n3,n4,n5}


%Create variable "sum" and variable "count". Set both to 0.
	sum = 0
	count = 0

%Run a for loop to calculate the sum 
	For loop repeated 5 times, or whatever count is, adding each iteration value to variable sum

%Calculate the average
	average = sum / count

%Find the smallest number in the set
	For loop repeated throughout value set
		If next n < current n
			set next n = smallest
		else
			continue through loop

%Find the largest number in the set
	For loop repeated throughout value set
		If next n > current n
			set next n = largest
		else
			continue through loop


Print ("The average is:" + average)
Print ("The smallest value is:" + smallest)
Print ("The largest value is:" + largest)


End
